  text: 'DRA: Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, the alpha-level `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` label has been updated to `resource.kubernetes.io/admin-access`. Admins using the alpha feature and updating from 1.33 can set both labels, upgrade, then remove `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` when no downgrade is going to happen anymore.'
