  text: 'kube-apiserver: Added support for disabling caching of authorization webhook
    decisions in the `--authorization-config` file. The new fields `cacheAuthorizedRequests`
    and `cacheUnauthorizedRequests` could be set to `false` to prevent caching for
    authorized or unauthorized requests. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#using-configuration-file-for-authorization
    for more details.'
