  text: Added support for CEL expressions with escaped names in the structured authentication
    config. Using `[...]` to access claims or user data was recommended when names
    contained characters that would otherwise need escaping. CEL optionals with `?`
    could be used where has was not applicable â€” for example, `claims[?"kubernetes.io"]`
    or `user.extra[?"domain.io/foo"]`.
