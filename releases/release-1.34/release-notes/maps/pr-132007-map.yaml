  text: Updated the HPA controller so that it no longer emitted a `FailedRescale`
    event if a scale operation initially failed due to a conflict but succeeded after
    a retry; it now emitted a `SuccessfulRescale` event in this case. A `FailedRescale`
    event was still emitted if all retries were exhausted.
