  text: The Kubernetes API server merged selectors built from `matchLabelKeys` into
    the `labelSelector` of `topologySpreadConstraints`, aligning Pod Topology Spread
    behavior with Inter-Pod Affinity. To prevent breaking existing Pods using `matchLabelKeys`,
    this scheduler behavior was preserved until v1.34. Upgrades from v1.32 to v1.34
    should be done incrementally (v1.32 → v1.33 → v1.34), ensuring Pods created at
    v1.32 with `matchLabelKeys` are scheduled before reaching v1.34. Controllers relying
    on `matchLabelKeys` no longer need to handle them directly and can use `labelSelector`
    instead. The new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge`,
    enabled by default, controls this behavior.
