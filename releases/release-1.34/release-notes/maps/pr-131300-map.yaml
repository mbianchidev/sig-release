  text: 'kube-apiserver: Promoted the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature
    to beta, which enabled external signing of service account tokens and fetching
    of public verifying keys. This was accomplished by enabling the beta `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner`
    feature gate and specifying the `--service-account-signing-endpoint` flag. The
    flag value could either be the path to a Unix domain socket on the filesystem,
    or be prefixed with @ to indicate a Unix domain socket in the abstract namespace.'
